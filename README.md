# Connect Drilled Sticks

Working towards more robust rapid-assembly mechanisms components for [Connect](https://nustem.uk/connect) devices. These sticks are based on lollipop stick dimensions, pre-drilled for paperclip linkages and pivots. The paddle-shaped things are intended as servo holders. Size reference:

The source document is in Affinity Designer format because that's what I had to hand at the time (Illustrator was taking an age to update itself). Other documents exported from that.

## Revisions:

* **2022-02-15** -- cut-out in servo paddle shrunk: the first test cut had a hole about 1.5mm too large in each axis, so now we know more about laser kerf.
* **Older** -- 5mm width version was a guess, now thought to be too small. Lolly sticks turn out to have 9mm width.
